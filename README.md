Ive gotten requests of adding exportable mod-settings to my mods from users that are putting together mod-packs and would like to bundle specific mod-settings with the pack.
Instead of implementing this per mod I wrote this mod instead.

This mod adds two small buttons at the top of the mod-options window for all mods (apart from HugsLib as that uses its own options-file for all mod-settings).
With these you can export the current mod-settings to a folder (default is the Desktop-folder but is changable in the mod-settings) and the file is then used to import the mod-settings.

The importing is done by overwriting the current settings with the imported file and then reloading the mod to apply the updated mod-settings. This can trigger warnings/errors depending on how the mod-settings are applied by the mod. If you notice some issues with a mods settings a simple way to reapply the imported settings is to restart the game.

There is also an option to export or import all active mods settings from this mods settings-window.

Since modding is just a hobby for me I expect no donations to keep modding. If you still want to show your support you can gift me anything from my [Wishlist](https://store.steampowered.com/wishlist/id/Mlie) or buy me a cup of tea.
